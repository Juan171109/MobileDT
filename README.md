# MobileDT

A demo project for my Mobile System Development paper.
The primary functions for this app include:

1. A dashboard page with a list of asset cards. Each asset card represent a machine in the manufacturing process.
2. Clicking on a card from dashboard will open asset detail page. There are asset basic information on the detail page and real-time data monitoring for multiple sensors.
3. The sensor data showed on asset detail view are from firebase database which collect data from a simulator app.
4. There is logic in this MobileDT app which will send event notification when temperature value exceed limit value 28Â°C.
